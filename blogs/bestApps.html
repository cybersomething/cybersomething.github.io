  <p class="lead">Ever wondered how to practice safe sex online? Well, this blog is the second of a series that can help you learn how to be safer both online and offline in terms of sex, privacy and consent.</p>
  <hr>
    <h2>Signal</h2>

    <h2>What platform should I send it on?</h2>
    <p>This is the very first blog post, however, there was so much content for this, I've made a <a href="../blogs/bestApps.html">new blog post</a> for this! But I'll still put a very condensed version of it here incase you don't have time to read another blog post!</p>

    <p>The safest way to do this is by using a secure messaging service such as signal - it's encrypted and relatively secure, you can also set the messages to disappear after a certain amount of time. I know that not everyone just has this app installed already and it has to use your phone number, which if you're just wanting a casual thing, you might not want to share this with the other person(s).</p>
      
<p>There's another alternative app, called 'Privates!' which is a bit like Snapchat but revolves a lot more around secure image sharing. It's got all the same features such as time till the image disappears and if they've screenshotted, however there's a few key differences between Privates! and Snapchat.</p> 

<p> You can set the security level to the level you want to have with the person you're speaking to, which can mean a few things, it can automatically toggle features such as motion detection - the reciever must keep their phone still, which means screenshotting/screenrecording and showing images to people can be difficult as they normally need to move their phone to do this action. Another interesting feature that can be toggled is users having to use one or two fingers to open a message, this also prevents them from using another device/screenshotting/screenrecording the photo/video. You can also recall messages if a user hasn't viewed them yet, so if you do decide that you don't want to send that picture, you can easily just delete it.</p>
      
<p>The app that you'll most likely have already installed would be snapchat - it can be used to share nudes, as images and videos disappear after viewing once (twice if they replay the snap) and also has the ability to show you if the other person(s) have screenshotted your photo/screenrecorded your video. <b>However it can be bypassed fairly easily if they've got a jailbroken device, using google assistant, third party recording apps and by using airplane mode </b> - so definitely don't put all your faith in it for sending nudes.</p>
