  <p class="lead">Ever wondered how to practice safe sex online? Well, this blog will be the first of many that can help you learn how to be safer both online and offline in terms of sex, privacy and consent.</p>
  <hr>
    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>Before you send any photos, make sure you establish consent with the other person(s) about sending each other intimate images of each other, <b>this consent should not be forced or coaxed and if it's revoked by yourself or the other person(s), it should be respected, no matter what.</b> Once consent has been established, you need to make sure that you specifically state that you do not give consent for the photos/videos to be shared online or with anyone else and is strictly for their eyes only. An example of what this statement could be is:</p>
    
    <h4><i>"Before I send any photos, I want to make it clear that these photos are for your eyes only, they should not be shared with anyone else and I do not want them screenshotted/recorded or stored on your phone."</i></h4>
    
    <p>The statement doesn't have to be as formal as the one above, but make sure you convey the fact <b>you don't want these images shared with anyone else and don't want them screenshotted or saved</b>. Make sure you screenshot the statement and their response, this can be used as evidence that you absolutely did not agree for any images of yourself to be posted/shared incase the other person(s) abuse your trust or try to use the images against you. 
   
    <hr>
    <h2>Watermarking your photos</h2>
    <p>So, you've all agreed to send nudes to each other and that you won't share any of these images, you can get to the 'nitty gritty' part, what you can do to further protect yourself and identify those who have shared your images, is by watermarking your nudes.</p>
    
    //images to go here lmao
    
    <p>When you're watermarking your nudes, you should put the other person(s) tag or name in the watermark, and place it in an area of the photo that they can't crop it out or try and photoshop out without distorting what you're trying to show off. The smaller and more hidden the watermark is, the more likely the watermark won't be tampered with - however, you can just put a watermark of any size and colour over your image, having a watermark is better than having no watermark.
    <hr>
    <h2>Identifying Features... To hide or not to hide?</h2>
    
    <hr>
    <h2>What platform should I send it on?</h2>
    <p>So, you might have started the conversation on Tinder/Bumble/Hinge or, it might be on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram,e.t.c but you might want to move it to a 'more private setting'. The safest way to do this is by using a secure messaging service such as signal - it's encrypted and relatively secure, you can also set the messages to disappear after a certain amount of time. I know that not everyone just has this app installed already and it has to use your phone number, which if you're just wanting a casual thing, you might not want to share this with the other person(s).</p>
      
<p>There's another alternative app, called 'Privates!' which is a bit like Snapchat but revolves a lot more around secure image sharing. You can set the </p>
      
<p>The next <i>~best~</i> thing would most likely be snapchat as images and videos disappear after viewing once (twice if they replay the snap) and also has the ability to show you if the other person(s) have screenshotted your photo/screenrecorded your video <b>however it can be bypassed fairly easily if they've got a jailbroken device, using google assistant, third party recording apps and by using airplane mode<h5>(https://social.techjunkie.com/can-snapchat-detect-a-screen-recorder/)</h5> </b> - so definitely don't put all your faith in it for sending nudes.</p>
